# Antarang (Financial Assistant & Crowdfunding Ration

Antarang is a **Financial Assistance & Crowdfunding App** made for people in India who need immediate financial assistance during difficult times like COVID-19

# Problem Solution:

- COVID-19 has left lakhs of people in India unemployed, mainly since a large population of the country comprises daily wage workers, with no way to sustain themselves during these difficult times. Through, "Antarang" we aim to make people self-reliant by helping to reduce their expenditure, with the help of Government COVID-19 relief funds and people contributing through crowdfunding.

- Recently people in India are willing to contribute towards COVID-19 relief funds, and the government is focusing on widespread use of PDS system to help separated migrant workers, could we crowdfund a ration system to help those in need? People will be able to buy supplies, pay rent, recharge prepaid connections, by performing these actions now, and pay them later. The "Antarang" app is paired with ration cards that already provide us with vital data required to evaluate a household's financial situation, data that isn't present can be collected via the app.

- During the pandemic, little/no state support forced many to borrow extensively through informal channels to make their ends meet, which has left many highly in debt due to informalized interest rates. With the help of the prioritization algorithm in our app, "Antarang" people will be able to manage their small debts and borrowing efficiently, which will eventually help them in reducing their expenditure for essential utilities so that they have to pay back less than they spent.
- In response to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, the government has announced several schemes. However, due to no single view of "who is getting what?" and "who should get what?" government can't identify the people in real need. Our app "Antarang", can strengthen the One Nation, One Ration Card Scheme by integrating Aadhar with TPDS, which will help to identify the beneficiaries more accurately and address the problem of inclusion and exclusion errors. So that we can assure the help is reaching the right people by eliminating ghost(fake) beneficiaries.

# Challenges We Ran Into:

- Our app will work perfectly in integrating future schemes of GOV like UBI(Universal Basic Income)
- Intergrating Blockchain technology to build trust with donors,security will be improved a lot and recipients, other stakeholders reach the right people i.e we will need to learn about it.
- Porting app to feature-smart phones(such as Jio Phones)
- Delivery or ticketing system integration for pickup.
- Improvement of priortization algorithm.
